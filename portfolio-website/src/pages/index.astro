			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Jonathan Byrne, a Games Computing student at the University of Lincoln. I am currently in my 4th year of MComp study. I have experience with: Python, C#, C++, Java (self-taught), Unity and Unreal, along with OpenCl and PhysX from my time at university. I have also participated in game jams both as a solo developer and working with others in a team. I am a keen learner who is willing to take on new challenges and improve my skillset as a programmer. I am a keen lover of films from many genres and countries and music such as rock, as well as games from both indie and Triple A developers. Because of this, I try to blend my interests together, such as a film shot generator to make film more easy to understand in my third year project, or a game that has difficulty generated by music for my fourth year project.
