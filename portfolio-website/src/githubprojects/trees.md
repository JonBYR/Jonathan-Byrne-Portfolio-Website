description: This was a game made in my 3rd year of study in a 2 person team. My tasks in this team were to; create procedurally generated levels, scripts to create a visible timer, level loading, camera perspective, instantiatting new objects, seperate gamemodes, high scores, generating sprites and a pause menu. Outside of this, I also made a settings menu and UI and helped with post processing.
