description: This project was created with the aim of using an algorithm to predict what film shots (i.e a close up shot of someone's face) in a generated shot sequence should be used for someone creating their own films. This shot sequence was then used in conjunction with Unity to show a visual representation of how shots looked, as well as allowing users to experiment with the visual output using Unity's camera. As well as this, an extra tab was programmed into Unity's UI in order to generate the shot sequence.
