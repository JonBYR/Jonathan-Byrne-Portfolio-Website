description: This was another game made in a 3 person team for a 48 hour game jam in my third year of study at the University of Lincoln. My contributions to the team were; scripts used for playing audio and sound effects, camera shake, level loading, moving and destroying objects, a UI slider, player damage and simple enemy ai. Tasks outside of scripting included using cinemachine and timeline for cinemactics, some blender modelling and using Unity's shader graphs and using Unity's post processing.
