description: This game was created as part of a 3 person team in a 24 hour game jam in my third year. My contributions to the team were to create the opening cinematics using cinemachine and timeline, creating materials for levels and using scripts for loading levels, camera shake, skipping cutscenes and fetching a required material to be used between levels via scripts.
