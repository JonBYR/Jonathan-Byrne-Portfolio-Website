description: This portfolio website was created using the program Astro. I had never used this program before, but with the help of tutorials and the advice of friends who had experience with this program I was able to create this website. This has helped me to appreciate the benefits of using Astro, such as more streamlined programming, inbuilt components such as props and css styling that can be easily changed to affect the whole website.
